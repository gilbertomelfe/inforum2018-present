    \begin{frame}{Conclusions}{The answer to the RQ. is...}

        \RQ{}. How do execution time and Package and RAM energy consumptions are affected by the use of a lazy or strict data structure implementation?

        \medskip

        \begin{itemize}

            \item Energy consumption is proportional to the execution time, and
	    \item strict evaluation tends to be more efficient in terms of execution time and energy consumption than the lazy evaluation


        \end{itemize}

        \begin{itemize}

            \item create/use more real-world benchmarks
            \item explore laziness vs strictness in more complex algorithms that rely on data structures (sorting or graph search algorithms)


        \end{itemize}
